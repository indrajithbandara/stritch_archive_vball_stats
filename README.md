# NAIA Mens Volleyball Stats
I played collegiate volleyball about 7-8 years ago now. I am writing this program to make sure there are offline archived copies of mens volleyball stats for Cardinal Stritch University. Releasing with GPL in case anyone wants to modify for their own team.

# to add for fun
make it a virtualenv and install packages required, then use pip freeze to generate requirments.txt file to add to version control 

make virtualenv, activate, and install pkgs in requirements file. can be used on fresh server deploy 
```bash
virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```
